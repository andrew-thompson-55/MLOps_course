# Benefits of Using GitHub Actions for MLOps
# Integration: Works seamlessly with GitHub repositories.
# Customizability: Allows defining specific workflows tailored to project needs.
# Reusability: Modular workflows can be reused across projects.
# Cost-Effective: Free for public repositories and limited free minutes for private ones.
 

# Best Practices for Creating MLOps Workflows
# Use Descriptive Names: Name workflows and steps clearly (e.g., "Train Model," "Deploy Model").
# Test Locally First: Ensure scripts work locally before integrating them into the workflow.
# Use Secrets: Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) as GitHub Secrets to keep them secure.
# Divide Workflows: Split workflows into logical segments (e.g., testing, training, deployment).
# Monitor Runs: Use the GitHub Actions dashboard to track workflow execution and troubleshoot failures.
